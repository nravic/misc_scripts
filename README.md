# misc_scripts
Collection of scripts I've written or come across, mostly in bash. 
Care with use, might be in testing stages and/or dangerous to simply download and run.
## FAQ
Any questions can be directed to me either on irc (usually on freenode #archlinux, #emacs) at @nravic or email me at nravic@protonmail.ch.
